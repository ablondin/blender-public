# Blender Public

This repository contains blender files that I want to share.

## Content

The actual content is the following:

- `minor-bob`, a character I used in my INF3135 class for the Winter 2016
  semester. Bob is a minor that mines stones. Right now, there are two
  available animations: walking and jumping.
- `race-car`, an animation of a car racing through a track. Note that the image
  used has been found on
  [Gamasutra](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6477/a_rational_approach_to_racing_game_.php?print=1)
- `cubes`, a Blender file and a script that allows one to generate random pile
  of cubes with materials.
- `plant`, another Blender project that allows one to generate fractal plants.
